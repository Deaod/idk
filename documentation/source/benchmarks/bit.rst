Bit Function Benchmarks
=======================

.. note::

	|benchmark_warning|

The below benchmarks are done on a machine with the following relevant compiler and architecture details:

* *Compiler*: Clang 13.0.0 x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
* *Standard Library*: Microsoft Visual C++ Standard Library, Visual Studio 2022 (Version 17.0)
* *Operating System*: Windows 10 64-bit
* *CPU*: Intel Core i7: 8 X 2592 MHz CPUs
* *CPU Caches*:

  * L1 Data 32 KiB (x4)
  * L1 Instruction 32 KiB (x4)
  * L2 Unified 256 KiB (x4)
  * L3 Unified 6144 KiB (x1)

There are 4 benchmarks, and about 7 kinds of categories for each. Each one represents a way of doing work being measured.

- **naive**: Writing a loop over a ``std::array`` of ``bool`` objects.
- **naive_packed**: Writing a loop over a ``std::array`` of ``std::size_t`` objects and using masking / OR / AND operations to achieve the desired effect.
- **ztdc_packed** (this library): Writing a loop over a ``std::array`` of ``bool`` objects.
- **cpp_std_array_bool**: Using the analogous ``std::`` algorithm (such as ``std::find``) on a ``std::array`` of ``bool`` objects.
- **cpp_std_vector_bool**: Using the analogous ``std::`` algorithm (such as ``std::find``) on a ``std::vector<bool>``, or one of its custom methods to perform the desired operation.
- **cpp_std_bitset**: Using the analogous ``std::`` algorithm (such as ``std::find``) on a ``std::bitset<...>`` or one of its custom methods to perform the desired operation.



Details
-------

As of December 5th, 2021, many standard libraries (including the one tested) use 32-bit integers for their ``bitset`` and ``vector<bool>`` implementations. This means that, or many of these, we can beat out their implementations (even if they employ the exact same bit manipulation operations we do) by virtue of using larger integer types.

For example, we are faster for the ``count`` operation despite Michael Schellenberg Costa optimizing MSVC's ``std::vector<bool>`` iterators in conjunction with its ``count`` operation, simply because we work on 64-bit integers (and roughly, the graph shows us as twice as fast).

.. note::

	This is a consequence of having a permanently fixed ABI for standard library types, meaning that even if theoretically MSVC could be faster, a person can always beat out the standard library every single time **if** that standard library has long-lasting ABI compatibility requirements.
